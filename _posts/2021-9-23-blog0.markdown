I learned about Git version control system and how its used to maintain vast majority of code without disruption between group members who are controlling it. 

I know the commands like "Git add .", "Git push origin", "Git Commit -m", "Git checkout branch" etc

 Before this class I was well aware of git. I learned how it can be integrated with other softare. Quick story, before git was created programmers would email the code to each other before deploying. This created alot of confusion and frustration amongst them. Git being created took technology level.
