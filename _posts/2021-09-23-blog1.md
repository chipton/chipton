I learned about LINUX distro's and primarly terminal on macs. The command line is my best for operations due to its open source capabilty opposed to microsoft capability. The command line is more of better use for me. The linux distro's are also my fav, especially when it comes to ubuntu. I'm more comfortable using command lines instead of GUI. I know of command lines such as "cd", "Ls", "Cd ..", "mkdir", "touch" and so on.
